## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--scratchpad` flag (and the matching `--layout`/`--template` step field) to move a window to
  Sway's scratchpad, runs last after every other action — pairs well with `--mark`/`--floating`/
  `--width`/`--height`/`--position` for the classic "dropdown terminal" pattern.
